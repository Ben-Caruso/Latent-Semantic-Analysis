# Latent-Semantic-Analysis

Code based on this paper http://lsa.colorado.edu/papers/dp1.LSAintro.pdf written in 1998 by researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder. I made this notebook in order to get a better understanding of the concept of Latent Semantic Analysis, which analyzes text by creating a term frequency matrix and performing singular value decomposition to obtain a correlation matrix that understands word and passage similarity in the context of the given documents.
